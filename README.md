# Machine-Learning-Project (1)

Data science and machine learning projects using classification, clustering, and regression techniques. Includes real-world datasets like weather, traffic, and customer data.

üîç Projects Overview:
1. Classification with Rain Dataset
Notebook: Rain Dataset_classification.ipynb
Dataset: Rain Dataset.csv
Description: This project focuses on building a classification model to predict weather patterns based on the Rain dataset. The model utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify rainy days from the provided features.
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

2. Clustering with Wholesale Customers Dataset
Notebook: Wholesale customers_clustering.ipynb
Dataset: Wholesale customers data.csv
Description: This project applies clustering techniques, such as K-means, to segment wholesale customers based on their purchasing patterns. It aims to identify key customer segments to support marketing and sales strategies.
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn

3. Regression with Traffic Dataset
Notebook: Traffic Dataset_regression.ipynb
Dataset: Traffic Dataset.csv
Description: This project focuses on predicting traffic volume using regression models. The analysis explores the relationship between various traffic-related features and the volume of vehicles on the road.
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used:
Python
Jupyter Notebooks
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn

üìà Datasets:
Rain Dataset: Used for classification of weather patterns.
Wholesale Customers Dataset: Used for clustering customers based on their purchasing behavior.
Traffic Dataset: Used for regression analysis on traffic volume.
